# 🎮 TicTacToe‑AI  
### 🤖 Smart AI Powered Tic Tac Toe using Minimax Algorithm

> Play Tic Tac Toe against an intelligent AI that never loses.  
Built with Python and Artificial Intelligence logic using the Minimax algorithm.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
**TicTacToe‑AI** is a Python-based game where a human player competes against an intelligent AI opponent.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm**, a popular decision‑making algorithm in Artificial Intelligence and game theory.

This project demonstrates:
- Game logic
- Artificial Intelligence
- Decision making algorithms
- Recursion & backtracking

Perfect for students and developers learning AI & Python.

## 🤖 How AI Works (Minimax Explanation)

The AI uses the **Minimax Algorithm** to choose the best move.

### 🔍 Working Principle
- Two players:
  - **AI → Maximizing player**
  - **Human → Minimizing player**
- AI checks all possible future moves
- Chooses move with best outcome

### 🧠 Scoring System
- AI win → +1  
- Human win → -1  
- Draw → 0  

AI selects the move with highest score.

### 🔁 Recursive Strategy
Minimax works by:
1. Checking available moves  
2. Simulating each move  
3. Calling itself recursively  
4. Evaluating result  
5. Returning best move  

Because Tic Tac Toe has limited possibilities, AI becomes unbeatable.
